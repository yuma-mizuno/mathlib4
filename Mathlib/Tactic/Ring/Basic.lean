# `ring` tactic

A tactic for solving equations in commutative (semi)rings,
where the exponents can also contain variables.
Based on <http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/courses/tt-2014/read/10.1.1.61.3041.pdf> .

More precisely, expressions of the following form are supported:
- constants (non-negative integers)
- variables
- coefficients (any rational number, embedded into the (semi)ring)
- addition of expressions
- multiplication of expressions (`a * b`)
- scalar multiplication of expressions (`n • a`; the multiplier must have type `ℕ`)
- exponentiation of expressions (the exponent must have type `ℕ`)
- subtraction and negation of expressions (if the base is a full ring)

The normalization procedure is implemented in `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring.Common`.

`ring1` solves the goal when it is an equality in *commutative* (semi)rings,
allowing variables in the exponent.

This version of `ring` fails if the target is not an equality.

* `ring1!` uses a more aggressive reducibility setting to determine equality of atoms.
